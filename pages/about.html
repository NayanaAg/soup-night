                    <p class="about-text">Welcome to my silly website! I'm a UX designer with experience in web design,
                        professional writing, and marketing strategy. I spent a long time thinking about what kind of
                        website I wanted and after a couple ideas that fizzled out in the wireframing stage, I settled
                        on a website about events. I love organizing fun activities and holidays for my friends, from
                        things like trivia and scavenger hunts to elaborate dinners and paint nights. I'm hoping to keep
                        updating this site with information about our next event and changing up the colour palette to
                        match the theme. Soon, I'll also add a "blog" section with our past events so we can all look
                        fondly back on pictures of our favourite moments together.

                                <blockquote>The second time I ever met Nayana in person was at a cabin in the middle of
                                    nowhere without signal with a group of people I had never met in person. It was for
                                    a Christmas weekend event that included trivia, cooking, and much more. I didn’t
                                    expect to come back alive, but it was an amazing trip filled with excitement,
                                    hospitality, kindness, and even romance?? (I officiated a wedding for 2 people in
                                    the woods). Nayana is an amazing event planner and ensures that everyone always
                                    feels included and comfortable. I would recommend others also experience her
                                    events/trips, at least once.

                                    Over the course of a wonderful cottage getaway, surrounded by Nayana and a couple of
                                    other soon-to-be-close friends, I underwent a metamorphosis. The exquisite and
                                    decadent Christmas feast filled my stomach, just as her company filled my soul. I am
                                    now a better person for it and I highly recommend Nayana to any people interested in
                                    a friend or an event.

                                    nostalgic memories. The scavenger hunt she (and Will) organized was definitely the
                                    highlight—it was very fun and was a great ice-breaker. It brought friends from
                                    different circles together through puzzles, trivia, and exploration. I had such a
                                    great time that I was inspired to start helping plan our future adventures! 10/10
                                    would recommend.
