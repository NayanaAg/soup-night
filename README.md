# Welcome to soup night!
# 27/09/2024
an invitation to a night of drinking and discussing soup

---

This website gives information about an event that I'm hosting soon with my friends called Soup Night. I decided on three main pages: a homepage to inform people about what the event actually is, a "details" page which tells them everything they need to know about the event, how to attend, and the hosts, and then an "about" page in case people stumble upon the website after the event is over and want to know more about me.  


I had a lot of fun working on this website because I was able to get my friends involved in the process too. Amanda drew the little chibi versions of us on the "details" page, and everyone wrote fun testimonials about our past events. I also included a couple dynamic features, like a countdown leading up to the event and a Buzzfeed-style quiz which tells you which soup you should bring based on an image you pick.

A couple improvements I can make are: 
* adding more specific media queries to address certain moving elements (countdown, quiz, testimonial) so they display better on medium-sized and smaller screens
* adjusting the testimonial height to be fixed instead of flexible so the controls aren't always moving 
* connecting this site to my portfolio (under progress!) so people have a natural journey flow towards my professional content
* learning how to produce forms in javascript instead of HTML so I can change the submission redirect and customize the page a bit more


You can [see my work process page](https://nayanaag.github.io/soup-night/pages/process.html) for my mini sitemap, some wireframes, and color palette information.

Thank you for visting, and I hope you liked the site! :)
